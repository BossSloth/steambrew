# Uninstalling

<Tabs>

### Automatic

To uninstall Millennium on windows, we use a PowerShell installer script. To run the script, open PowerShell, paste the following command, and press enter.
The uninstaller lets you uninstall Millennium components in modules, and everything it will/ever has put on the disk will be caught by the uninstaller.

```powershell
iwr -useb "https://steambrew.app/uninstall.ps1" | iex
```

:::info
If you receive any errors while trying to uninstall Millennium, [reinstall it](/users/installing). This will clean your installation of Millennium.
You can then proceed with the removal process.

### Manual

Close Steam and navigate to your Steam directory and then look through the [assets repository](https://github.com/ShadowMonster99/millennium-steam-binaries), or find manually find the filenames associated with Millennium.

The installed binaries on your system may be listed below depending on the version of Millennium.
As of Millennium v2.25.1 the binaries are:

-   `user32.dll`
-   `python311.dll`
-   `millennium.dll`

If you want a deeper clean of Millennium, you can also remove all of its assets. As of Millennium@v2.2.2, the assets are found in the paths below (replacing \{steam\} with steams actual location)

-   `{steam}/steamui/skins` - User Themes
-   `{steam}/plugins` - User Plugins
-   `{steam}/ext` - Millennium Internal Data

If you don't know where steam is installed, check how you can [find your steam path](../faq/finding-steam.md)

    <summary>AUR uninstallation</summary>

Remove the `millennium` package with your AUR helper:

```sh
paru -Rns millennium
```

You'll need to delete your configuration and plugins manually:

```sh
rm -rf "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/millennium" "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/millennium"
```

And that's it!

</details>

```sh
sudo rm -rf /usr/lib/millennium /usr/share/millennium "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/millennium" "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/millennium"
```

Then, replace the patched Steam binary with the original binary:

```sh
sudo mv /usr/bin/steam.millennium.bak /usr/bin/steam
```
