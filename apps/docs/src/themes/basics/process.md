# The Creative Process

If you've made it this far in the guide, you've hopefully learned about the [developer tools](../introduction/environment.md) and seen the [quick start guide](../introduction/quick-start.md) for themes. If not, please go and check those out first as they are crucial to making a theme.

If you just want a quick example of the basics, check out the [example](#example) section below. Otherwise, keep reading for a good overview of the creative process.

## Designing

This may seem obvious, but you can't make a theme without some sort of design in mind. There are many different methods for this, and different levels as well. Some people go into it with a vague mental image of how they want to make the client look. Some people mock up their own designs in Photoshop or other similar software. There's also people that use something else as a reference like how the theme [Material](https://steambrew.app/theme?id=ipYjqODds05KMcvh7QJn) is based on [Googles Material 3 Design](https://m3.material.io/) application.

We would definitely recommend the latter two options when it comes to designing a themes. It helps keep your theme consistent, and prevents forgetting what you wanted to do.

### Layout & Usability

When you're designing your theme, keep in mind that you have essentially full control CSS-wise. This means you can completely alter the layout and user experience. This will often come down to personal preference, but you can work towards delivering a specific layout and user experience. Consider what you want to prioritize for the user, or what you find frustrating about the current client layout. Those are often good sources of inspiration. On a side note, depending on the complexity of your theme, you might notice moving / styling _some_ areas in the client just can't be done without JavaScript. Don't worry though, we'll cover this more in the [scripting](../advanced/scripting.md) section of the docs.

### Color Scheme

Every good theme needs a good color scheme, and there are plenty of tools online that help you generate entire color palettes such as [Coolers](https://coolors.co/) (no that's not a typo üòÅ) which can automatically generate entire palettes or work with existing ones to generate complementary or shaded schemes. Definitely play around with these tools to come up with your own color scheme and do your best to stick with it as you make your theme. Having a set color scheme before implementing makes the code more seamless from the start, and it also makes it smoother because you don't have to stumble over different parts of the design to make a decision.

### Icons

This may seem like it's not a very important part of a theme, but icons can have a profound effect on the look and feel of the client. Many themes choose to override Steam's icons with their own in order to better match the vibe they are going for. There are many free (and open source) icon packages out there that you can either use or take inspiration from.
