# Overview

Welcome to the theme development docs, we're glad you made it!

We highly recommend you read this documentation in order as to not skip anything. It's laid out in a very linear fashion, with each section building on concepts from the previous ones. Starting from the fundamentals of how Steam's UI is structured, we'll progressively cover more advanced topics like component targeting, CSS injection methods, and theme optimization.

If you're new to Steam theming, don't worry - we'll start with the basics and explain Steam's specific quirks along the way. If you're already familiar with CSS and web development, you'll find that many concepts translate directly, though Steam does have its own unique patterns and limitations to be aware of.

By the end of this guide, you'll understand how to create, test, and distribute themes that can completely transform the Steam client's appearance while maintaining functionality and performance.

## Prerequisites

While we'll cover the Steam-specific aspects thoroughly, you should have a solid understanding of:

-   CSS fundamentals
-   Browser developer tools for inspecting and debugging
-   Basic file management and text editing

If you're comfortable styling web applications, you'll feel right at home with Steam theming.
