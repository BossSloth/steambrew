## Startup Issues

Startup issues when using Millennium can be frustrating. Here are some helpful tips to solve your issues.

### General Issues

Millennium requires an active internet connection on first setup, and so do some plugins.
If you're unconnected, or have had issues with network connectivity in the past, it might be a good place to start.
Millennium's logs will likely have network errors if this is the case.

While uncommon, some antivirus solutions like may cause issues with Millenniums runtime. If logs report permission errors, missing files, or related issues, it's a good idea whitelist Millennium from your antivirus.

### Millennium Files

-   millennium.dll
-   user32.dll
-   python311.dll

::: details Outdated or problematic plugins.
Whether you've recently installed a new plugin or not, it's entirely possible your issue is related to a plugin.
Take a peek around the Millennium logs for any errors related to plugins. If you find a problematic plugin and don't have a solution, can simply remove the plugin from your plugins folder.

If you have the know how, It's also recommended report the issue directly to the developer of the plugin either on Github or in our discord server.

::: details Outdated Millennium version

An easy way to check for Millennium updates is to simply rerun the install command from the [installation page](./installation.md).
Don't worry, this won't reset any configuration.

This is caused by one or more of Millennium's UI components breaking due to Steam updates. More often than not if you're experiencing these issues you're on Steam beta; and switching back to stable will fix the issue.
