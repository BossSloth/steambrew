# Submitting Addons

Submissions are handled through the our [GitHub](https://github.com/SteamClientHomebrew/).

## Submitting a theme

Simply create a new issue on the [Millennium](https://github.com/SteamClientHomebrew/Millennium) repository with the information about your theme attached.

## Submitting a plugin

Create a new pull request on the [Plugin Database](https://github.com/SteamClientHomebrew/PluginDatabase) repository with the information about your plugin attached. For further information regarding your pull request, consult the README of the Plugin Database.

## Approval Process

Due to our small team size, we have no guarantees for how long a review can take. Typically, they take no more than a month, but they can be as quick as a day.

## Approval

If your plugin is approved it will appear on https://steambrew.app. The website will automatically render your repositories README and relevant data.

## Plugins

Plugins will not auto update themselves. Every time you make a change to your repository, you'll need to open a new update pull request, and it will have to be successfully merged before Millennium users can download and use it. Although this may seem frustrating, we put the safety of our end-users above developer experience.
